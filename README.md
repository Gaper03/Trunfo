# Trunfo

This project was developed for the Object-Oriented Programming course at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP). It is an adaptation of a famous card game, called 'Super Trunfo'. This virtual version of the game has a political theme - using brazilian politicians as characters for the cards -, having a comic touch while being impartial.

### How to play? 
The first step is to execute the command ``pip3 install kivy`` in your terminal.
Next, after installing 'Kivy' (GUI Library), run the command: ``python3 main.py``.
Note: you must have Python3 installed in your computer. If you don't have it, click [here](https://www.python.org) to download it.
